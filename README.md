# Optimal_prediction_of_MVP_award

---
### Description
This educational project was made under the guidance of Daniil Merkulov on optimization methods in MIPT.

I am absorbed in basketball so I predicted the player who won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award.
As a model I used the Random Forest Classifier. The main idea of the project was to find the optimal hyperparameters. I used Optuna (TSEsampler, GridSampler, RandomSampler) to search for them.
