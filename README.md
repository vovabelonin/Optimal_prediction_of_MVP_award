# Optimal_prediction_of_MVP_award

---
### Description
This educational project was made under the guidance of Daniil Merkulov on optimization methods in MIPT.

I am absorbed in basketball so I decided to predict MVP award in NBA. I trained Random Forest Classifier to predict player who would get this award. And I used Optuna to search optimal hyperparameters.
